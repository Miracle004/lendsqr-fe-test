## 🔍 Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks:
1. **Visual Fidelity** - Design must be pixel-perfect
   - Mitigation: Use design tokens, regular design reviews
   
2. **API Mocking** - Need 500 records with realistic data
   - Mitigation: Use mocky.io or json-generator.com
   
3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Must work across all devices
   - Mitigation: Mobile-first approach, test on multiple viewports

### Medium Priority Risks:
4. **Unit Testing Coverage** - Must include positive & negative tests
   - Mitigation: Test-driven development approach
   
5. **GitHub Quality** - Clear commits and documentation
   - Mitigation: Semantic commit messages, comprehensive README
